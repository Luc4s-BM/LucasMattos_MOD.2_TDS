    You
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Barbarisms by Barbaras
    With pointed heels
    Victorious Victorias kneel
    For brand new spanking deals
    Marching forward, hypocritic
    And hypnotic computers
    You depend on our protection
    Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
    Everybody's going to the party
    Have a real good time
    Dancin' in the desert
    Blowin' up the sunshine
    Kneeling roses disappearing
    Into Moses' dry mouth
    Breaking into Fort Knox
    Stealing our intentions
    Hangers sitting, dripped in oil
    Crying, "freedom"
    Handed to obsoletion
    Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
    Everybody's going to the party
    Have a real good time
    Dancin' in the desert
    Blowing up the sunshine
    Everybody's going to the party
    Have a real good time
    Dancin' in the desert
    Blowin' up the sunshine
    Blast off, it's party time
    And we don't live in a fascist nation
    Blast off, it's party time
    And where the fuck are you?
    Where the fuck are you?
    Where the fuck are you?
    Why don't presidents fight the war?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why don't presidents fight the war?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Kneeling roses disappearing
    Into Moses' dry mouth
    Breaking into Fort Knox
    Stealing our intentions
    Hangers sitting dripped in oil
    Crying, "freedom"
    Handed to obsoletion
    Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
    La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
    Everybody's going to the party
    Have a real good time
    Dancin' in the desert
    Blowing up the sunshine
    Everybody's going to the party
    Have a real good time
    Dancin' in the desert
    Blowin' up the sun
    Where the fuck are you?
    Where the fuck are you?
    Why don't presidents fight the war?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why don't presidents fight the war?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    Why do they always send the poor?
    They always send the poor
    They always send the poor
